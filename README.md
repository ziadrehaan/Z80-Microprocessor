# Z80 with Arduino Project



### Overview
The **Z80** microprocessor is an iconic **8-bit microprocessor** with a **16-bit address bus** introduced by **Zilog** in 1976. It was widely used in early personal computers, video game consoles, and embedded systems. Known for its **simplicity** and **flexibility**, the Z80 continues to be a key part of computing history.

### Key Features
- **16-bit address bus**: Allows access to up to **64KB of memory**.
- **8-bit data bus**: Processes 8 bits of data at a time.
- **Registers**: Includes **sixteen 8-bit registers**, such as **A** (accumulator), **B**, **C**, **D**, **E**, **H**, **L**, as well as **flags** and **control registers**.
- **Program Counter (PC)** and **Stack Pointer (SP)**: 16-bit registers for program tracking and function management.
- **Clock speed**: Operates between **2 MHz to 20 MHz** depending on the variant.
- **Rich Instruction Set**: Over 150 instructions for various operations, including arithmetic, logical, and data transfer.
- **Interrupts**: Supports both **Non-Vectored Interrupts (NMI)** and **Vectored Interrupts**.

### Applications
- **Personal Computers**: Used in early systems like the **Sinclair ZX80**, **ZX81**, and **TRS-80**.
- **Video Game Consoles**: Found in consoles like the **Nintendo Game Boy** and many arcade systems.
- **Embedded Systems**: Used in printers, scanners, and industrial equipment.

### Legacy
The Z80's design influenced subsequent processors and remains a teaching tool for understanding microprocessor architecture. Its simplicity and efficient design made it a popular choice in many embedded systems even long after newer processors emerged.
